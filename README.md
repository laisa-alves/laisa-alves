### Hello, I'm Laísa 🙋‍♀️

Aspiring Frontend Developer.


### About me

I'm a curious person, passionate about problem-solving. This passion led me to learn how to automate daily tasks. Yes, I have (quite a few) Excel spreadsheets that organize my entire life. Organization is another passion of mine, which fuels my desire to solve problems.

I'm studying Analysis and Systems Development and have experience with HTML, CSS, JS and React. Additionally, I have been venturing into mobile development using Flutter and Dart, focusing on providing exceptional experiences for mobile applications.

### Projects

I'm currently working on the [DaniTech](https://github.com/laisa-alves/ecommerce-app) app.

I'm learning Flutter, Dart, APIs, HTML, CSS, JS and React.

I also contribute to the [LadiesCode](https://github.com/ladiesCodeTech) app.


### Curiosities and hobbies

- Passionate about technology, innovation, and their real-world applications.
- Somewhat of a perfectionist 👀
- I have two furry best friends, Dani 🐶 and Mel 🐱
